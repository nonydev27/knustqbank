# Question Bank System

Over the years, many students have had challenges asking questions during lectures, etc. It is of this reason why Nonydev came up with the KNUST Question Bank

## How it works?

- Students will sign up & login into the system using their student email address [username@st.knust.edu.gh](#)
- After successfully logging in, the student's dashboard would contain each course title with their respective lecturers
- Each lecturer has an admin page/channel to be able to answer all questions
